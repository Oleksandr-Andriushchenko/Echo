 You must implement this proptocol on each UIViewController which is used in coordinators.

 - define reusable view to display data;
 - RootViewGettable to get  access to controller`s view;
 
 Controller CAN NOT:
 - Show other controllers;
 - Know how to present itself;
 - Modify any data before presentation.
