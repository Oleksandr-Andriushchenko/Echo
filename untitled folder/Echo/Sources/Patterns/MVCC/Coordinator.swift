 - Model - Data container, persistance object;
 - View - Object to represent data on UI. You must inherite Cotroller type to use it as View.
 - Controller - Object, which acts as the intermediary between the application's view objects and its model objects.
 - Coordinator - Entity, which allows to manage all controllers and sub-coordinators.

 - Navigate controllers (show and hide instack, modally and in any other way);
 - Subscribes on controller`s events and react on events;
 - Show or hide sub-coordinators if needed.
 - Impl AppErrorPresentable to display app errors.
